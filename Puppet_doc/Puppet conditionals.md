# Puppet Conditionals: A Guide with Examples

In Puppet, conditionals are a powerful way to control the flow of your code and make decisions based on various factors, such as facts, parameters, or external data. This guide covers different types of conditionals and provides examples for each.

---

## 1. **Conditionals: Controlling Flow**

Conditionals in Puppet allow you to perform actions based on specific conditions. The most common constructs are `if`, `unless`, and `case`.

---

## 2. **Selectors: Assigning Data Based on Evaluation**

Selectors in Puppet are a concise way to assign values based on a condition. They are similar to a switch statement in other programming languages.

### Syntax:

```puppet
$variable = $condition ? {
  'value1' => 'result1',
  'value2' => 'result2',
  default  => 'default_result',
}
```

### Example:

Assigning a package manager based on the operating system family:

```puppet
$package_manager = $facts['os']['family'] ? {
  'RedHat' => 'yum',
  'Debian' => 'apt',
  default  => 'unknown',
}

notify { "Package manager: ${package_manager}": }
```

## 3. **Case Statements**

Case statements are used to handle multiple conditions, making it easier to read and manage complex logic.

### Syntax:

```puppet
case $variable {
  'value1': {
    # Actions for value1
  }
  'value2': {
    # Actions for value2
  }
  default: {
    # Default actions
  }
}
```

### Example:

Configuring a service based on the operating system family:

```puppet
case $facts['os']['family'] {
  'RedHat': {
    package { 'httpd': ensure => installed }
  }
  'Debian': {
    package { 'apache2': ensure => installed }
  }
  default: {
    fail("Unsupported OS family: ${facts['os']['family']}")
  }
}
```

---

## 4. **Regular Expressions**

Regular expressions can be used in `case` statements and `if` conditions to match patterns in strings.

### Example with Case:

```puppet
case $facts['os']['name'] {
  /(?i)centos|redhat/: {
    notify { 'RHEL-based system detected': }
  }
  /(?i)ubuntu|debian/: {
    notify { 'Debian-based system detected': }
  }
  default: {
    notify { 'Unknown system detected': }
  }
}
```

### Example with If:

```puppet
if $facts['os']['name'] =~ /RedHat|CentOS/ {
  notify { 'This is a RHEL-based system': }
}
```

---

## 5. **If/Else Blocks and Operators**

`if` and `else` statements are used to execute code conditionally. You can combine them with logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### Syntax:

```puppet
if $condition {
  # Actions if condition is true
} else {
  # Actions if condition is false
}
```

### Example:

```puppet
if $facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat' {
  notify { 'This is a RedHat-based system': }
} else {
  notify { 'This is not a RedHat-based system': }
}
```

#### Logical Operators:

- `and`: Both conditions must be true.
- `or`: At least one condition must be true.
- `not`: Negates the condition.

Example with operators:

```puppet
if ($facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat') and ($facts['os']['release']['major'] >= 8) {
  notify { 'RHEL 8 or later detected': }
}
```

---

## 6. **Unless**

The `unless` statement is the opposite of `if`. It executes the code block only if the condition evaluates to false.

### Syntax:

```puppet
unless $condition {
  # Actions if condition is false
}
```

### Example:

```puppet
unless $facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat' {
  notify { 'This is not a RedHat-based system': }
}
```

---

## 7. **Difference Between String and Regular Expression**

Puppet allows you to compare strings directly or use regular expressions for pattern matching. Here's the difference:

### String Comparison:

- Direct comparison checks for exact matches.

Example:

```puppet
if $facts['os']['name'] == 'RedHat' {
  notify { 'This is RedHat': }
}
```

### Regular Expression Comparison:

- Matches patterns, allowing for more flexibility.

Example:

```puppet
if $facts['os']['name'] =~ /RedHat/ {
  notify { 'This is RedHat (matched via regex)': }
}
```

### Key Difference:

- `'RedHat'` checks if the string is exactly "RedHat".
- `/RedHat/` matches any string containing "RedHat" (e.g., "RedHatEnterprise").
