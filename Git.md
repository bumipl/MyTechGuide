Here are some basic Git CLI (Command Line Interface) commands along with their descriptions:

1. git init

Description: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating the necessary data structures and files to start version control.

2. git clone <repository URL>

Description: Creates a copy of a remote Git repository onto your local machine, allowing you to work with the codebase locally.

3. git add <file(s)>

Description: Adds the specified file(s) to the staging area, preparing them to be included in the next commit.

4. git commit -m "<commit message>"

Description: Records a snapshot of the staged changes as a new commit in the version history. The commit message should describe the changes being made.

5. git status:

Description: Displays the current status of the working directory, showing which files have been modified, added to the staging area, or committed.

6. git diff:

Description: Shows the differences between the current state of the files in the working directory and the last committed version.

7. git pull:

Description: Fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current branch. It combines git fetch and git merge.

8. git push:

Description: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository, updating the remote branch with your changes.

9. git branch:

Description: Lists all existing branches in the repository. The current branch is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

10. git checkout <branch name>:

Description: Switches to the specified branch, updating the working directory to reflect the state of that branch's last commit.

11. git merge <branch name>:

Description: Combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch. Typically used to integrate feature branches into the main branch.

12. git remote -v:

Description: Displays a list of all remote repositories associated with the current repository along with their URLs.

13. git log:

Description: Shows a chronological list of commits, including their commit messages, authors, dates, and unique commit IDs.

14. git reset <file(s)>:

Description: Unstages the specified file(s), removing them from the staging area but leaving the working directory unchanged.

15. git stash:

Description: Temporarily stores the changes in the working directory and the staging area, allowing you to switch to a different branch without committing the changes.

16. git tag <tag name>:

Description: Creates a lightweight reference (tag) to a specific commit. Tags are often used to mark important points in the project's history, such as release versions.
