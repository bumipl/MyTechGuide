# Generating YAML Files

- **Don't write YAML files; generate them!** 
  ```bash
  kubectl create deploy myapp --image=nginx --replicas=3 --dry-run=client -o yaml > myapp.yaml
  ```

## After generating the YAML file, use one of the following:

1. **kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml** - Applies the YAML code to currently running resources. If the resource doesn't exist yet, it will be created.
2. **kubectl create -f myapp.yaml** - Creates the resource from the YAML file. If it already exists, an error is generated.
3. **kubectl replace -f myapp.yaml** - Replaces current application code with new YAML code provided.
4. **kubectl delete -f myapp.yaml** - Deletes the application.

### Additional Commands:

- **kubectl get ...** - Show current resource details.
- **kubectl get deployments.apps myapp -o yaml | less** - To check the entire configuration listed in YAML.
- **kubectl explain deploy.spec | less** - You can check all fields possible in the deployment specification.

### Checking Deployments:

- **kubectl get deploy** - To check what containers are running.
- **kubectl get deploy <container> -o yaml > <container>.yaml** - To cat yaml code of a specific container and redirect it to the file.
