# Understanding Kubernetes Scalability

## Manually Scaling

You can manually scale deployments using the following commands:

- `kubectl scale ... --replicas=3`: Scale the deployment to have 3 replicas.
- `kubectl edit`: Live edit a running application and change the number of replicas.

**Note:** You can't scale pods individually; you need to scale the entire deployment.

Example usage:

```bash
kubectl edit deployments.app mynewapp
kubectl get all
kubectl scale deployment mynewapp --replicas=0
kubectl get all
