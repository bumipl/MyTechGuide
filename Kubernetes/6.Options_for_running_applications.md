# Options for Running Applications

## Deployment
- Runs Pods, adding features like scalability, availability, and zero-downtime application updates.

## DaemonSet
- Used to run one application instance on each cluster node.

## StatefulSet
- Used for applications that need persistent state and naming.

## Job
- Used to run a Pod once, until it completes.

## Pod
- A single running instance of an application, normally used for analysis and troubleshooting only.

# EXAMPLES - Running Pods

- `kubectl get pods` - Shows currently running Pods, regardless of how they were started.
- `kubectl describe pods` - Shows details about a Pod.
- `kubectl get pods <podname> -o yaml` - Shows the YAML specification of the Pod as it is currently running in the Etcd cluster database.
- `kubectl delete pods mypod` - Deletes a Pod.
- `kubectl delete pods --all` - Deletes all Pods.
- `kubectl run mypod --image=nginx` - Runs a Pod with the specified image.
- `kubectl run -h | less` - Displays help for the `run` command.
- `kubectl run -i -t busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never` - Runs busybox with an interactive terminal; "`--restart=Never`" means that if you exit the container, it will mark it as completed and won't be restarted. The opposite of this is "`--restart=Always`".
- `kubectl delete deployments.apps lab4` - Deletes pods that are managed by a deployment.
