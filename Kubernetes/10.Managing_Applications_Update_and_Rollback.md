# Managing Application Update and Rollback (with 0 downtime)

- Major changes to a deployment will have the deployment history updated.
- While changing deployment history, a new ReplicaSet is created, while the old ReplicaSet is maintained with 0 Pods in it.
- This makes it easy to undo a change.

## Commands

- `kubectl rollout history`: Overview of recent changes.
- `kubectl rollout undo`: Revert a change.

## Example:

```bash
kubectl create deployment rollingnginx --image=nginx:1.15
kubectl rollout history deployment <container>
kubectl edit deployment rollingnginx # set nginx:latest
kubectl rollout history deployment container>
kubectl describe deployment rollingnginx 
kubectl rollout history deployment rollingnginx --revision=2 # it shows exactly what changes have been applied
kubectl rollout history deployment rollingnginx --revision=1 # it shows exactly what changes have been applied
kubectl rollout undo deployment rollingnginx --to-revision=1
