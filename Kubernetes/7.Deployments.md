# Deployment Benefits

Using deployments offers many benefits:

1. Easy scalability
2. Managing availability
3. Zero-downtime application updates

Running applications in a Deployment is the standard - **DO NOT** run naked Pods!

- `kubectl create -f myapp.yaml`: To run an application from a YAML file.
- `kubectl create deployment myapp --image=myapp`: To run an application from the CLI.
- `kubectl run`: Starts stand-alone Pods and shouldn't be used except when troubleshooting.

For more information, you can check the help documentation:

```bash
kubectl create deploy -h | less
