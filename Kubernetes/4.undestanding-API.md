# Understanding APIs in Kubernetes

**API** - Application Programming Interface; it contains the blueprint of how to work with specific solutions.

In Kubernetes, the API is not a singular entity; rather, it's a collection of APIs. This collection defines the resources that can be used in the Kubernetes environment.

## Working with the API

1. **kubectl api-resources**: Shows a list of resources that are defined in the API.
2. **kubectl api-versions**: Shows resource versions.
3. **kubectl explain**: Allows users to explore attributes of Kubernetes resources as they are defined in the API.
