# Using Labels

- Labels are used by Kubernetes core processes as well as users to identify applications.
- Deployments keep track of managed Pods using labels and selectors.
- Network-related resources like services also utilize labels.
- Administrators can use labels to implement update strategies like canary deployments.
- `kubectl label ...`: Manage labels.

## Example:

```bash
kubectl get all --show-labels
kubectl get all --selector app=rollingnginx
kubectl label deploy rollingnginx type=static
kubectl label deploy rollingnginx app- # to remove label
kubectl get pods --show-labels
